This is an Average calculator that uses the TextIO file. The
user is asked for to enter some numbers and the program simply
finds the sum and the average of these numbers.

Project Title: Average Calculator

Description: This program takes the average of how ever many numbers the user enters.

Languages used: Java

For this project, I used two files: AverageCalculator.java and TextIO.java.

AgeCalc.java- The user is aske how many numbers they would like to enter and the
TextIO.java file is used to get the numbers from the user.

TextIO.java- this is just used to get the user input at certain points of the
program.

To run this project, compile the AverageCalculator.java file and run it in the
terminal.
